# Welcome to the World's Wonderful Weather App!

## Project Description

### Creating a Weather App with React.js

This project is an app we created using our combined knowledge of React and the quite helpful internet. You're able to type in any ZIP Code in the world and this app will return both the current weather and some helpful information about that area of the world.

You're able to favorite any areas of the world you look up which will then save them for quicker, easier viewing next time. There is also a random button that displays a completely random area of the world and it's weather information each time.

Give it a try!

### Setting Up

Start by creating a copy of this github in your computer's terminal and navigating to that new directory.

Next run `npm install` to get things going.

Then use `npm start` to open the App in your browser.

### Using The Website

You will be asked to enter the ZIP Code of the desired location that you would like to know the weather for.

Once the ZIP has been entered, press the submit button to the right of code you entered.

On the App will display the weather and some useful information about that location based on the weather. There will also be favorite and random buttons that can be used to save locations or let you discover a completely foreign one.
