# Welcome to the World's Wonderful Weather App!

## Project Description

### Creating a Weather App with React.js

This project is an app we created using our combined knowledge of React and the super helpful internet. You're able to type in any city or ZIP Code in the world and this app will return the 5 day weather forecast for that area showing the different tempatures and weather throughout that timeframe.

You're able to favorite any city you look up by pressing the heart which will then save them in the favorites tab off to the side for quicker, easier viewing next time. There is also a language option that translates the text on the App to Spanish or French (this is currently a work in progress and converts some, but not all the text) making it easier to understand for people from many backgrounds of life.

Give it a try!

## How It Looks

### Overall Page View

### App Being Demonstrated

## How to Use It

### Setting Up

Start by creating a copy of this github in your computer's terminal and then navigating to that new directory.

Next run `npm install` and 'npm run server' to get things going.

Then use `npm start` to open the App in your browser.

### Using The Website

You will be asked to enter whatever city in the world you would like to know the weather for. If you prefer to search by Zip Code, you can click on the magnifying glass in the sidebar and this will allow you to search by Zip.

Once the ZIP has been entered, press the submit button next to the information you entered to get your result. The list of cities doesn't have a submit button, but rather just requires a city to be clicked from the dropdown list.

The App will then display the weather forecast for the requested location for the next 5 days. There is also a favorite button that can be used to save locations for quicker viewing next time and those are saved under the heart icon in the sidebar.

Some stretch features we are currently working on are:
-Getting all the text to change to Spanish or French, then starting to look in to other languages to add.
-Work on having different world clocks displaying times from around the world as an option in the sidebar.
-Have a working map function in the sidebar that brings up the globe and allows users to click where they want to know the weather.
